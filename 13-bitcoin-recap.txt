Blockchain
==========

Is a list of blocks. Unlike a regular list, each block uses a hash
pointer to point to the previous block of data. Each has pointer
encodes the block it points to as well as a hash of the block itself.

So every block contains a hash of the block it extends!

We are going to remember the head of the list, using a hash pointer
itself. Thanks to the use of hash pointers, this becomes a
tamper-evident log. This means that we can keep on adding data to the
log and if at any point someone attempts to alter what was recorded in
the log, we are going to be able to detect it.

Distributed consensus
=====================

Bitcoin's key challenge: Nodes of the network need to agree on the
state of the blockchain.

Identities
==========

There are no node identities in Bitcoin. In a P2P system there is no
centralized authority to hand out and control identities. Sybil
attacks are possible where attackers create new nodes at will. Instead
identities in Bitcoin are key pairs. But there are no real identities
in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is based on pseudo-anonymity. Any user can create
any identity at any time.

Bitcoin does not incorporate a way to dicover addresses. Alice and Bob
need a different mechanism.

Transactions
============
Transactions are broadcast to the network. Transactions are
instructions that say what value amount of Bitcoin is transferred and
from which source address to which destination address. The coin is a
chain of transactions.

What it means for a transaction to be part of the blockchain?

It means that it has received lots of confirmations. There is no fixed
number. A commonly used heuristic is 6. The more confirmation a
transaction receives (meaning the more blocks that extend the block
containing that transaction) the more certain one can be that the
transaction is part of the consensus of the blockchain.

P2P Network
===========

The P2P network is to communicate all transactions as well as new
blocks to all P2P nodes. It is a best effort service. The security of
the system does not come from the perfection of the network. In fact
the underlying assumption is that the network is unreliable.

Instead the security comes from is from the blockchain and the
consensus protocol.

Nodes always consider and add to the longer branch of the consensus
chain and discard blocks that are invalid.

Orphan blocks
=============

These are blocks that don't make it the consensus chain. Could be due
to an invalid transaction or a double spent attempt. It could also be
due to latency in the network and the fact that two miners competing
to compute the proof-of-work puzzle, end up finishing within a few
seconds of each other. And so both blocks were broadcast near
simultaneously onto the network.

Mining
======

A subtle point regarding miner is that if Alice has 100 times the
mining capacity of Bob. This does not mean that Alice will always win
against Bob the race to finding the next block. This means that on
average Alice has a probability of success that is 100 times the one
of Bob. On the long term, Bob will find on average 1% of the blocks
that Alice does.

Miners are special type of node that compete in the game creating new
blocks and are rewarded for their efforts. We expect the number of
miners in the long term to be at the equilibrium in the amount of
expenditure they incur due to hardware and electricity versus and the
reward they receive from block creation reward and transaction fee
reward.

Incentives
==========

1. block reward

Creator of a block gets to include a special coin-creation transaction
in the block that is transferred to a chosen recipient address. The
value is fixed: currently 25 BTC, halves every 4 years. Block creator
gets to collect the reward only if the block ends up on the long-term
consensus branch. This incentivizes nodes to play by the rules.

There's a finite supply of Bitcoins. Total supply of 21 million. Block
reward is the only way in which Bitcoin are created. This reward will
stop working in 2040, according to current rules. Besides this
incentive, there is another one.

2. transaction reward

Creator of a transaction can choose to make output value less than
input value. The remainder is a transaction fee and goes to the block
creator. The idea is that the total sum of fees can be a reward that
incentivizes miners. Currently transaction fee is voluntary but it
will progressively become more and more expected in order to get a
certain quality of service.

Proof-of-work
=============

The main idea behind consensus in Bitcoin is that one random node gets
to decide which block gets appended to the block chain. Because of the
decentralization and lack of any notion of global time, we must
approximate selecting a random node. The idea is to select nodes in
proportion to a resource tha no one can monopolize. If this resource
is computing power, it's called proof-of-work.

Equivalent views of proof-of-work:
1. Select nodes in proportion to computing power
2. Let nodes compete for the right to create block
3. Make it moderately hard to create new identities

Proof-of-work in Bitcoin is bashed on a hash puzzle. To create a
block, a node must find a nonce s.t.
H(nonce || prev_hash || tx_1 || ... || tx_N) is very small,
within a certain target space. If the hash function H is secure, then
the only way to succeed is to try enough nonces until you get lucky.

There are three main properties for proof-of-work:
1. it must be difficult to compute (as of Aug 2014, about 10^20
   hashes/block)
2. it has a parameterizable cost (hardcoded in the software, set by
   the rules). Nodes automatically re-calculate the target every two
   weeks. The goal is to maintain an average time between blocks of
   about 10 minutes.
3. trivial to verify. Once a block is created and broadcast, every
   node can trivially verify that the nonce found is correct. Nonce is
   published. Nodes can simply verify that:
   H(nonce || prev_hash || tx_1 || ... || tx_N)) < target space

Solving puzzles is probabilistic. It is approximated by a Poisson
process. The probability density function of any node finding a block
follows an exponential distribution.

Key security assumption
=======================

Attacks infeasible if majority of miners weighted by hash power follow
the protocol.

What can a "51% attacker" do?

Steal coins from existing address? NO

Suppress some transactions?
* From the blockchain YES
* From the P2P network NO

Change the block reward? NO - attacker does not control copies of
Bitcoin software running elsewhere

Destroy confidence in Bitcoin? YES - main practical threat

Consensus
=========

The notion of consensus permeates Bitcoin

We need consensus regarding its value. This is given with its exchange
rate. But consensus goes deeper in Bitcoin. You need consensus about
state.

What does it mean to own some Bitcoins? This relies on the notion of
consensus on the state of the network. It means that the blockchain
recorded in the network contains a chain of transactions towards my
addresses that when combined sums up to the amount of Bitcoins that I
own. That is the ultimate nature of truth in Bitcoin. So ownership of
Bitcoins is nothing more than other nodes thinking that I won that
amount of Bitcoins.

There also need to be consensus regarding the rules of the system.


Q&A


1. Bitcoin mining seems to me like a huge ecological disaster, as I
   understood it, it really constitutes a race to waste computational
   resources which constantly requires to throw in more and more
   computing power in order to maintain a steady source of income.

   -> Correct. "In the world of cryptocurrencies, Proof of Work turned
      into a monster devouring electricity in the race for mining
      profit. Around 2012 the first serious complaints appeared, when
      the total performance of Bitcoin network surpassed that of the
      most productive supercomputer in the world (indeed, comparing
      PFLOPS and Gigahashes is not exactly correct, but... sometimes
      it is). "Waste of energy!" everyone cried." [1]

   So I wondered:
   * has there been any attempt to greenify bitcoin ? has this topic
     already been investigated or is it broken beyond repair ?

     -> proof-of-stake is an idea to avoid energy wastage. The concept
     is "the limited resource used for voting can be found not only on
     the outside (consumed power and hardware), but also inside the
     system itself: the digital coins." [1]

   * I have the impression that this resource waste stems from the PoW
     model that has been chosen. Can the proof of ownership alleviate
     that problem and how does it work ?

     -> not with proof of ownership. "Proof of Ownership is a method
     that uses Bitcoin's decentralized ledger (also called blockchain)
     or Bitcoin-related technologies to track the different owners of
     a certain information over the time." [2]

     -> there are alternatives to proof-of-work. one is
     proof-of-stake, which asks users to prove ownership of a certain
     amount of currency (their "stake" in the currency). however it
     has its own set of problems. [3]

     "The Proof of Stake problem lies in the fact that it pays to mine
     a number of alternative branches simultaneously. You can do this
     for free, with non-zero chance of success, i.e. increase the
     expected return." [1]

     Also see [4]

     I believe the ultimate answer here is that it is still an open
     problem to figure out what mechanism makes the best trade-offs
     while guaranteeing the resulting system is secure.

   * An other way that might imho lead to a reduction of this problem
     would be to "re-centralize" a little bit the mining process. For
     instance, the set of "mining nodes" could registered to a
     "central registrar" (ie similar to DNS) and use an explicit
     consensus algorithm (i.e. raft since it has a protocol to deal
     with the addition/decomissionig of nodes) to decide what node
     will produce the next block.

     -> it might as well be but the trade-off is that you give up on
     decentralization of the system, which is the core philosophy
     behind Bitcoin.

     -> central banks are attempting to develop their own centralized
     blockchain technologies (e.g., Chain, RSCoin). details should be
     public as they aim to be open source technologies.

     * Would this architecture still be safe (assuming a fee is being
       paid for the registration of each mining node, in order to rule
       out the sybil attacks ) ?

       -> depends on what you mean by safe... if through
       centralization, there is chance that a single entity would
       control over 50% of the network. then, it is no longer
       technically secure. One could say that it is still safe, if you
       can trust the central entity. But can you?

2. Also, I don't understand the rationale behind the fixed limit on
   the number of bitcoins that will ever be produced. As it was said
   in the 2nd presentation, Bitcoin is secure because people do trust
   it and use it in order to perform trades.
   * So why does the protocol seeks to avoid inflation so badly ? I
     mean, from an economic perspective, inflation is THE tool which
     is traditionally used to encourage people to buy trades and spend
     their money so as to avoid the 'melting money' effect. Therefore,
     I am wondering if there is anything I missed which could explain
     why Bitcoin has set this limit.

     -> I am not sure I can answer that as it requires understanding
     the system from an economical perspective, which is beyond the
     scope of this course. Someone gave a thoughtful answer to this on
     Piazza.


3. Is the reason behind bitcoins only anonymity ?

   -> The stronger design philosophy behind Bitcoin is on
   decentralization rather than anonymity. Bitcoin only provide
   pseudo-anonymity.

4. What happens if I lost my private key ? How can I spend the money
   link to my lost public-private key pair ?

   -> That is a big problem. Essentially you will lose your coins
   because you can no longer spend them since you cannot sign new
   transactions for your coins. It is even hard to tell whether some
   coins are being lost or being saved up.

5. Isn't it easy for someone to listen to all transactions done by a
   given pseudonym because of the  peer-to-peer network used ? What
   can it implies ?

   -> It implies that pseudo-anonymity is not privacy. There is
   research (including the reading for the Bitcoin lecture) that
   demonstrates how it is possible to associate certain transactions
   with identities and use histories of these transactions to at least
   profile the real identity of Bitcoin addresses.
